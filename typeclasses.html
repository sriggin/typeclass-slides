# Type-classes: WTF are those?!

# What is a typeclass?
A type class is a type system construct that supports 'ad hoc polymorphism'.
  * It is a type system construct because it is an advanced feature of some advanced type systems. Python is not included.
  * Ad hoc polymorphism is more or les a fancy way of saying that a function can be written to operate on arbitrary types, in this case, members of the typeclass.

A class/trait defined against a type
  * `trait Foo[T]` can define a type-class `Foo`
  * Some type `U` is a member of type-class `Foo` if there exists an instance of `Foo[U]`.



---

# The Open/Closed Principle

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Principles are important to software, or something.

Broken down: You should be able to extend/improve things without changing them.
  * Extend/improve things to make them more reusable, more capable, safer, etc.
  * Don't change things so that you don't break any other uses of them.



---

# Two bad examples: Composition and Inheritance

* Composition: Extend the capabilities of something by building on it
  * (Generally) No substitution between inner and outer: Goodbye, Liskov!
  * There is a maintenance headache to work around this involving proxies
* Inheritance: Extend/modify in a limited way
  * Trade modification guarantees for substitution!
  * Unless the trait/interface/superclass is locked down, you can modify anything and break consumers

Both of these cases are fully specified when you define something, but what if you want to extend something that isn't yours?



---

# Beautiful Composition

```scala

interface Adder {
  def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int
}

class ConcreteAdder {
  //closed to modification
  final override def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left + right
}

class PairAdder(adder: Adder) extends Adder {
  // yay, re-use for the simple cost of maintenance!
  final override  def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = adder(left, right)

  def addPair(left: (Int, Int), right: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = {
    adder(left._1, right._1) -> adder(left._2, right._2)
  } // yay, extension!
}

```

Issues:
* This example breaks down with non-trivial interfaces, of course.
* `Adder` looks like it should be generic. `addPair` is a nice extension, but I want to use an `Adder[Tuple2[Int, Int]]` to get some REAL reuse.



---

# Inheritance with Composure

```scala
class Adder {
  def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left + right
}

class Arithmeticker extends Adder {
  def subtract(left: Int, right: Int) = add(left, -right)
}

class Madder extends Adder {
  //oops, my finger slipped, I swear!
  override def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left - right
}
```

Issues:
* Extensions are limited to what is left open to extension (non-final)
  * Want to extend `String`? You're SOL!
* Mistakes in sub-classes can break invariants of super-class


---

# This is too abstract, I need an example: "Show" things

```scala
trait Show[T] {
  def show(value: T): String
}

implicit object ShowInt extends Show[Int] {
  def show(value: Int) = value.toString
}

case class Wallet(cash: Double, cards: List[String])

implicit object ShowWallet extends Show[Wallet] {
  def show(value: Wallet) = "$" + value.cash +
    " and a bunch of cards: " + value.cards.mkString(", ")
}
```

* `Int` and `Wallet` are members of type-class `Show`
* More types can be added as more instances of `Show` are defined for different types



---

# "Show" Example, Cont'd

* Let's get more complicated with this type-class: `Tuple2`
  * `Tuple2` is generic with 2 parameters. We could rely on `toString` but that is fixed and cheating.
  * In the spirit of ad hoc polymorphism, we should utilize `Show` members to build the appropriate instance for `Tuple2[L, R]`

```scala
implicit class ShowTuple[L, R](implicit showL: Show[L], implicit showR: Show[R])
    extends Show[(L, R)] {

  override def show(value: (L, R)): String =
    implicitly[Show[L]].show(value._1) + "->" + implicitly[Show[R]].show(value._2)
}

```

* Because this isn't an instance so much as a constructor, these are sometimes called _constructor classes_. Don't bother. It's a type-class constructor.
* What is special about `Tuple2`? It's generic! 
* But why does that matter? It's a _higher kind_.



---

# Brief distraction: What is a higher kind?

I'm not going to go into details now, but _Kind : Type :: Type : Value_

* As an example, `3` is a value of type `Int`.
* `Int` is a type of kind `*`, as is `List[Int]`.
* `List` is a type of kind `* -> *`. Just think about that.
  * This can be thought of as a type-constructor.
  * `T => List[T]` looks like `* -> *` if you squint.
* If you don't understand or like generalizing over types, try generalizing over kinds.
* If you aren't already confused, the kind for `Tuple2` is `(*,*) -> *`


---

* What are some syntax sugars that make that less painful?
  * Context bounds: `def foo[T: Bar](value: T) = ...` defines a function `foo` on type `T` which must be a member of type-class `Bar`
  * Companion objects and `apply`:
```scala
trait Foo[T] { ... } // some type-class

object Foo {
  def apply[T](implicit evidence: Foo[T]): Foo[T] = evidence
}

implicitly[Foo[T]] /* is now equivalent to */ Foo[T]
```

---

* How is it different from an Interface/Trait?
  * Interfaces/traits are mixed into a type, essentially being bolted on. There is necessarily an is-a relationship
  * These are built into the definition of a type, they can't be changed outside of that definition
  * As an example, try to add a capability to String and see how that works out for you.

---

* What do typeclasses accomplish?
* They allow you to define arbitrary capabilities for some type completely separate from the type itself

---

* What are some built-in examples?
  * Numeric - Generic numeric operations
  * Ordered - External definitions for ordering elements of some type
  * ClassTag - "Reified type information", allows attachment of compile-time type information at runtime to work around type erasure with generics

---

* What are some real-world examples of possible uses?
  * Database Relationships
  * Serialization

---

* What are some pain-points around type-classes?
  * Ambiguous implicit instances - Nothing stops you from defining multiple instances of a type-class for some time, except for that pesky compiler
  * Syntax - Type-classes are not a formal language construct in Scala, they are available because of implicits and generics.

---

* What syntax makes them not suck?
  * Context bounds
  * Use of `apply` in companion objects
