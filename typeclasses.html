# Type-classes: WTF are those?!



---

# What is a type-class?

A type-class is a type system construct that supports 'ad hoc polymorphism'.

* It is a type system construct because it is an advanced feature of some advanced type systems. Python is not included.
* Concretely, it is class/trait defined against a type
  * `trait Foo[T]` can define a type-class `Foo`
* Some type `U` is a member of type-class `Foo` if there exists an instance of `Foo[U]`.
* A type `T` might be a type-class if you could naturally say "there is a `T` for that type"
  * `Option` and `List` aren't type-classes. They're _monads_, duh!

---

# WTF is Polymorphism?

A brief refresher from Wikipedia:

**Polymorphism** is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. A polymorphic type is one whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type(s). There are several kinds:
* **_Ad hoc polymorphism_: when a function denotes different and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on a limited range of individually specified types and combinations. Ad hoc polymorphism is supported in many languages using function overloading.**
* _Parametric polymorphism_: when code is written without mention of any specific type and thus can be used transparently with any number of new types. In the object-oriented programming community, this is often known as generics or generic programming. _This is polymorphism to functional programmers._
* _Subtyping_: when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass. _This is polymorphism to OO programmers._

---

# The Open/Closed Principle

> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Principles are important to software, or something.

Broken down: You should be able to extend/improve things without changing them.
  * Extend/improve things to make them more reusable, more capable, safer, etc.
  * Don't change things so that you don't break any other uses of them.


---

# Two Insufficient Examples: Composition and Inheritance

* **Composition**: Extend the capabilities of something by building on it
  * (Generally) No substitution between inner and outer: Goodbye, Liskov!
  * There is a maintenance headache to work around this involving proxies
* **Inheritance**: Extend/modify in a limited way
  * Trade modification guarantees for substitution!
  * Unless the trait/interface/superclass is locked down, you can modify anything and break consumers

Both of these cases are fully specified when you define something, but what if you want to extend something that isn't yours, like `String`?


---

# Beautiful Composition

```scala

interface Adder {
  def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int
}

class ConcreteAdder {
  //closed to modification
  final override def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left + right
}

class PairAdder(adder: Adder) extends Adder {
  // yay, re-use for the simple cost of maintenance!
  final override  def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = adder(left, right)

  def addPair(left: (Int, Int), right: (Int, Int)): (Int, Int) = {
    adder(left._1, right._1) -> adder(left._2, right._2)
  } // yay, extension!
}

```

Issues:
* This example breaks down with non-trivial interfaces, of course.
* `Adder` looks like it should be generic. `addPair` is a nice extension, but I want to use an `Adder[Tuple2[Int, Int]]` to get some REAL reuse.


---

# Inheritance with Composure

```scala
class Adder {
  def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left + right
}

class Arithmeticker extends Adder {
  def subtract(left: Int, right: Int) = add(left, -right)
}

class Madder extends Adder {
  //oops, my finger slipped, I swear!
  override def add(left: Int, right: Int): Int = left - right
}
```

Issues:
* Extensions are limited to what is left open to extension (non-final)
  * Want to extend `String`? You're SOL!
* Mistakes in sub-classes can break invariants of super-class


---

# Doesn't Scala give us something for this.. 'Enrich my library'?

Scala lets you transparently convert 1 thing to another using implicit conversions.
This is (now) called the 'Enrich my library' pattern because it allows you to
arbitrarily extend code that you don't own, including final classes like `String`!

```scala
implicit class RichString(val str: String) {
  def **(times: Int): String = {
    val sb = new StringBuilder
    for {
      i <- 0 until str.length
      c = str(i)
      x <- 1 to times
    } sb.append(c)
    sb.toString
  }
}

"wtf" ** 3 // "wwwtttfff"
```

---

# Where 'Enrich my library' falls short

* This pattern isn't polymorphic at all.
* This is pure composition, so any shortcomings from that still apply.

# This is too abstract, I need an example: "Show" things

```scala
trait Show[T] {
  def show(value: T): String
}

implicit object ShowInt extends Show[Int] {
  def show(value: Int) = value.toString
}

case class Wallet(cash: Double, cards: List[String])

implicit object ShowWallet extends Show[Wallet] {
  def show(value: Wallet) = "$" + value.cash +
    " and a bunch of cards: " + value.cards.mkString(", ")
}
```

* `Int` and `Wallet` are members of type-class `Show`
* More types can be added as more instances of `Show` are defined for different types


---

# How is this different from an Interface/Trait?

Interfaces/traits are mixed into a type, essentially being bolted on. There is necessarily an **is-a** relationship

These are built into the definition of a type, they can't be changed outside of that definition

Type-classes can be defined anywhere. They can even be defined multiple times, though this gets hairy, because implicits.


---

# "Show" Example, Cont'd

Let's get more complicated with this type-class: `Tuple2`

* `Tuple2` is generic with 2 parameters. We could rely on `toString` but that is fixed and cheating.
* In the spirit of ad hoc polymorphism, we should utilize `Show` members to build the appropriate instance for `Tuple2[L, R]`

```scala
implicit class ShowTuple[L, R](
  implicit showL: Show[L],
  showR: Show[R]
) extends Show[(L, R)] {

  override def show(value: (L, R)): String =
    implicitly[Show[L]].show(value._1) + "->" + implicitly[Show[R]].show(value._2)
}
```

* Because this isn't an instance so much as a constructor, these are sometimes called _constructor classes_. Don't bother. It's a type-class constructor.
* What is special about `Tuple2`? It's generic! 
* But why does that matter? It's a _higher kind_.



---

# Brief distraction: What is a higher kind?

I'm not going to go into details now, but _Value : Type :: Kind : Type_

* As an example, `3` is a value of type `Int`.
* `Int` is a type of kind `*`, as is `List[Int]`.
* `List` is a type of kind `* -> *`. Just think about that.
  * This can be thought of as a type-constructor.
  * `T => List[T]` looks like `* -> *` if you squint.
* If you don't understand or like generalizing over types, try generalizing over kinds.
* If you aren't already confused, the kind for `Tuple2` is `(*,*) -> *`

Fortunately, you only have to worry about this if you see `import scala.language.higherKinds`^

<cite>^ = Unless you work with me, in which case `-language:higherKinds` is passed to _scalac_ and all bets are off.</cite>

# Can we make this less painful?

Of course, Scala has a ridiculously complex syntax for cases like this!

Here are a few ways to help:
* Context Bounds
* Companion objects with `apply`
* Type-class builders



---

# Context bounds

```scala
def foo[T: Bar](value: T) = ...
```

* `T: Bar` means type `T` which must be a member of type-class `Bar`
* This is syntax sugar for adding an implicit parameter of type `Bar[T]` without a name.

  `def foo[T](value: T)(implicit ev$: Bar[T]) = ...`

* If a parameter doesn't have a name, how do you use it?
  * `implicitly[...]`! Ugh.


---

# Companion objects and `apply`:

```scala
trait Foo[T] { ... } // some type-class

object Foo {
  def apply[T](implicit evidence: Foo[T]): Foo[T] = evidence
}

implicitly[Foo[T]] /* is now equivalent to */ Foo[T]
```

This can be generalized with this trait:

```scala
import scala.language.higherKinds // You know what follows will be good

trait TypeClassCompanion[TypeClass[_]] {
  @inline def apply[T: TypeClass]: TypeClass[T] = implicitly[TypeClass[T]]
}

object Foo extends TypeClassCompanion[Foo] // Begone, superfluous line of code!
```

---

# Type-class builders

This is only mentioned because it looks like a Seanism, which is something I like.

```scala
trait Show[T] {
  def show(value: T): String
}

class ShowBuilder[T](fn: T => String) extends Show[T] {
  override def show(value: T): String = fn(value)
}

implicit val IntShow = ShowBuilder[Int](_.toString)
// WOW THAT'S UNREADABLY TERSE, THANKS SEAN!
```

* What do typeclasses accomplish?
* They allow you to define arbitrary capabilities for some type completely separate from the type itself

---

# Another Detour: Implicit Scope

Because type-classes in Scala are built on implicits, they benefit (suffer?) from the
rich (vastly overcomplicated) resolution rules for implicits. There is one rule in
particular that is nice for defining default type-class instances:

> SLS ยง2.7.2: The _implicit scope_ of a type `T` consists of all _companion modules_ of
> classes that are associated with the implicit parameter's type.

The _implicit scope_ isn't the scope for implicits, it is the fall-back scope used for implicit resolution when no other scopes can satisfy an implicit lookup. In plainer language, if you don't have an implicit `T` in scope, the compiler will try to look in the _implicit scope_ for `T` before failing.

The _implicit scope_ is therefore a great place to put default type-class instances.


---

# Default Type-class Instances

> SLS ยง2.7.2: The _implicit scope_ of a type `T` consists of all _companion modules_ of
> classes that are associated[1] with the implicit parameter's type.

[1] There are several rules that define which classes are "associated". The two that we care about most for type-classes are:

* The type itself
* Type parameters of the type

This means that for the type-class `Foo[Bar]`, the implicit scope includes the companion object for both `Foo` and `Bar`. This implies two things:

1. For a type-class `Foo`, put various default instances for `Foo` that are obvious in the companion object of `Foo` and they'll automatically be used.
2. For type `Bar`, put default instances of any type-classes or `Bar` in its companion object. 
---

# Give me a better example

Fine.

```scala
trait Foldable[T] { // You might also call this a Monoid
  def empty: T
  def merge(l: T, r: T): T
}

object Foldable extends TypeClassCompanion[Foldable] {
  // function is curried so type of fmerge can be inferred from fempty
  def build[T](fempty: T)(fmerge: (T, T) => T) = new Foldable[T] {
    def empty = fempty
    def merge(l: T, r: T): T = fmerge(l, r)
  }
  // default Foldable[Int], could be overridden with Foldable.build(1)(_ * _)
  implicit val intFoldable = Foldable.build(0)(_ + _)
  implicit val strFoldable = Foldable.build("")(_ + _)
}

def foldLeft[T: Foldable](xs: List[T]): T = xs match {
  case Nil => Foldable[T].empty
  case x :: xs => Foldable[T].merge(x, foldLeft(xs))
}

foldLeft(List("a", "bb", "ccc")) // "abbccc"
foldLeft(List.empty[Int]) // 0
```


---

# Scala Built-in Examples

`Numeric` - Generic numeric operations and conversions

```scala
def product[T](xs: Seq[T])(implicit n: Numeric[T]): T =
  xs.foldLeft(n.zero)(n.times)
```
  
`Ordering` - Defines comparison operations to define an ordering for a type

```scala
// From Seq
def sorted[B >: A](implicit ord: Ordering[B]): Seq[A]
```

`ClassTag` - "Reified type information", allows attachment of compile-time type information at runtime to work around type erasure with generics

```scala
def foo[T](value: Seq[T]) = value match {
  // Compiler warning: This case can't be tested because Seq[T] erases to Seq 
  case strs: Seq[String] => ... 
}

def bar[T: ClassTag](value: Seq[T]) = value match {
  // This works because the compiler utilizes the ClassTag to perform this check
  case strs: Seq[String] => ...
}
```

# Real-world examples of possible uses?

#### Database Representations and Relationships

Projects like `Slick` will define schema representations as case classes and use type-classes to translate and validate data.

#### Serialization

A prime example for _SolidFire_ would be JSON serialization. Something like this typeclass could be used for native-speed JSON serialization and deserialization without any reflection:

```scala
trait JSON[T] {
  def serialize(value: T): JsonData
  // Try because we have no structural guarantees with JSON
  def deserialize(data: JsonData): Try[T] 
}
```

---

# Do type-classes have pain-points?

Of course. This isn't Haskell.

#### Ambiguous implicit instances

Nothing stops you from defining multiple instances of a type-class for some time, except for that pesky compiler.

#### No Global Scope

In Haskell, type-classes have a property called _coherence_. There is a global dictionary for all type-class instances. A type can have at most 1 type-class instance. Scala isn't Haskell, so you can define type-class instances in a bunch of places, mix and match them, and specify an instance by passing the implicit type-class argument explicitly.

#### Syntax

Type-classes are not a formal language construct in Scala, they are available because of implicits and generics. Context-bounds make this slightly nicer, but this still feels a bit unnatural.
